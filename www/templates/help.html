                <h2>How to use</h2>
                <p>To use this app, choose either a game or movie to search for. Then, enter the title of the game/movie you want to view. If more than one game/movie matches the title, you will be required to select which game/movie you want to see details for, from the list displayed.</p>
                <p>The game/movie's aggregated review score, along with additional information will then be displayed.</p>
                <p>If you see a game/movie you wish to save, for quick viewing of the score later, simply press the 'Favourite' button at the bottom of the details page.</p>
                <h2>No locations being displayed</h2>
                <p>When on the game details page, if you do not see any locations appearing, follow these steps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1: Enable location services on your device.</li>
                    <li>2: If needed, allow this app to access your location details.</li>
                    <li>3: Restart the app (Close fully, and re-open).</li>
                </ul>
